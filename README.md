# crudPractice

Hi there!

This repo contains a Darth Vader CRUD app inspired by Zell Liew. The article walkthrough is posted below.

Link: https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

This was my introduction to a CRUD app. I read the article and followed along building the app. As a first run through, this article does a good job explaining every compoent of CRUD. It also walks you through setting up all the npm packages you will need as well as setting up MongoDB. Overall, a helpful first step to understanding web apps.

Lessons Learned:
  1. The role of dev dependencies. 
  2. What are the components of CRUD.
  3. The role databases play in fullstack web apps.
